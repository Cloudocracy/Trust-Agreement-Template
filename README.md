# Data Privacy Respecting Trust

Data Privacy Respecting Trusts (DPRT) are machine-readable vehicles for multiple organizations to securely, responsibly, and ethically combine their data for one or more shared purposes.  

This repository is an expanded derivation from versioned clauses and templates the BrightHive and its Trusted Partner Network use to develop and maintaining data trusts networks of organizations.

The Data Privacy Respecting Trust Agreement (DPRTA) makes use of an underlying data model called a *trust graph* to author the legal documents.
